Create a File Explorer
3 hours ago, Rasika Ingole
Design and implement a file explorer application using Ext JS tree panel that simulates a hierarchical structure of files and folders.
The application should incorporate the following features:

Requirements:
Display Icons:
Nodes in the tree panel should display icons based on their corresponding record types (e.g. folder, file).

Drag-and-Drop Functionality:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality in the tree panel to allow users to rearrange nodes by dragging and dropping them onto different nodes.
Provide clear and informative messages when dragging and dropping items, indicating whether the data already exists or not.

Unique Data for Each Folder:
Ensure that each folder in the tree panel contains unique data.

Add New Folders and Files:
Implement the ability to add new folders and files to the TreePanel.

Delete Folders and Files:
Allow users to delete folders and files from the TreePanel.
Implement confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions.

Move Items Up or Down:
Provide functionality to move folders and files up or down. Files can be positioned under the folder, but folders cannot be moved under files.
Ensure that the movement is visually represented in the TreePanel.

Search Feature:
Implement a search feature that allows users to search for specific records within the TreePanel.
Highlight or focus on the matching nodes.

Filtering Options:
Integrate filtering options for columns in the TreePanel.
Users should be able to filter nodes based on various criteria, such as name, date, or file type.
Context Menu:
Implement a context menu that appears when right-clicking on nodes, providing options such as move up, move down, expand, collapse and other relevant actions.

Copy and Paste Functionality:
Enable the ability to copy and paste nodes within the tree panel, allowing users to duplicate or move items efficiently.
Multiple Selection:
Allow users to select multiple nodes simultaneously, facilitating bulk operations like deletion, moving, or copying.
Breadcrumb Navigation:
Include a breadcrumb navigation bar to provide users with a clear path to the current location within the hierarchical structure.
Resizable Columns:
Enable users to resize columns in the tree panel to accommodate varying content lengths and improve overall visibility.
Collapsible Nodes:
Implement the ability to collapse and expand nodes in the tree panel, enhancing the user's control over the visibility of the hierarchical structure.
Keyboard Shortcuts:
Include keyboard shortcuts for common actions to enhance accessibility and improve the overall user experience.
